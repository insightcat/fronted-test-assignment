# Frontend developer test assignment

We aim to review the whole package - code quality, approach, functionality and design. We will review even unfinished bit and pieces, but you will score extra points by accomplishing main tasks and extra bonus steps.

Tasks

  1. Draw a pixel-perfect graph, based on https://www.figma.com/file/lEvDUSOvib0n4Fy5ahR8Ap/InsightCat-Test?node-id=0%3A1 (sign in to Figma to see the css/element details)
  2. Fill the graph with data, as in initialData (TestTask.vue)

Bonus assignment (optional):

  3. Generate data for the graph dynamically and make it update itself each 10 seconds
  4. Create 8 graphs like these on one page. Update each graph dynamically with different data each 10 seconds. Measure the load impact on browser.
  5. Wrap the graph with movable and resizable widget container, as shown here - https://pasteboard.co/Jk5gp31.png and here - https://pasteboard.co/Jk5tKME.png
  6. How can you improve load impact on browser in task #4?

It is not nesessary to base on TestTask.vue, you can write everything your way.

Commit your work to a public git repo and send a link to admin@insightcat.com
